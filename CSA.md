### What is a CSA?
A CSA is defined by the mutual commitment between producers and consumers. Simply put: CSA members pay in advance (monthly, in our case), and in return are guaranteed a weekly share of the local harvest. In a successful CSA, members feel empowered by the knowledge that they are supporting their local farmers and are personally invested in the produce they bring home.Â 
### What goes in the box?
CSA shares are all about variety--and seasonality. This means that the contents of the box change week to week, according to what your growers are harvesting. To give you a general idea, though, the figure below outlines what crops are in season in Kansas month to month.

We'll include 8 to 10 different items in each produce share, and at least one kind of meat and cheese in each protein share.
### Who are the growers supplying the CSA?
Although many of the growers you're familiar with from Prairieland's retail store are also supplying the CSA, there are a few new faces as well. This year, we're partnering with the following farms:
