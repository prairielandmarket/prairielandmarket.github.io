### What is a CSA?
A CSA is defined by the mutual commitment between producers and consumers. Simply put: CSA members pay in advance (monthly, in our case), and in return are guaranteed a weekly share of the local harvest. In a successful CSA, members feel empowered by the knowledge that they are supporting their local farmers and personally invested in the produce they bring home.Â 
### What's in the box?
CSA shares are all about variety--and seasonality. This means that the contents of the box change week to week, according to what your growers are harvesting. To give you an idea, though, the figure below outlines what crops are in season in Kansas month to month.
